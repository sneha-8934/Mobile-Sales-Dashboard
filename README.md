Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for mobile sales analysis, showcasing metrics like total sales, average price, and ratings across various dimensions (time, city, brand, and payment method).
Analyzed and visualized over 769.2M in total sales data and 19K total quantities sold, delivering insights on trends, payment distributions, and performance comparisons for the same period last year.
Completed the project within 30 days as part of a Power BI masterclass led by Satish Dhawale Sir, demonstrating proficiency in data visualization, DAX calculations, and dashboard creation.
